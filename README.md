# AquariumWaterChangeCalculator
This program calculates the percent of total water that you change in your fish aquarium.

I made this because it is pretty close to impossible to pour in EXACTLY 5 gallons of water in your 5 gallon bucket when you do water changes for your aquarium.

The way this program works is it takes the weight of water you have in a 5 gallon bucket and divides that by what the weight of 5 gallons of water should be (41.7 lbs). This will give you what percent of 5 gallons of water that you actually have in your bucket. You can then find out how many gallons of water you have in the bucket by multiplying the percent by 5 (the total gallon capacity of the bucket). The program will then take the amount of water in your bucket (in gallons at this point) and divide it by the gallon  capacity of your aquarium to find out what percent of your aquarium water you changed so you know when you need to change the water again.
